# Distributed-Database-Stock-Analysis
A term project for Advanced Database Management, implementing horizontal partitioning, replication, and query optimization on stock market data using MySQL and Python. The project evaluates data synchronization, query performance, and distributed database simulation using event schedulers.

# üìä Distributed Database Stock Analysis  
**Term Project - Advanced Database Management**  
**Zhenghao An | Boston University MET | December 2024**  

## üîç Project Overview  
This project explores **distributed database design and optimization** by implementing **horizontal partitioning, replication, and query performance analysis** on **stock market data** using MySQL and Python. Due to limitations with multi-instance MySQL and PostgreSQL Citus, the project simulates a distributed system within a **single MySQL instance** and uses Python to simulate multiple nodes.  

## üìÅ Repository Contents  
- **`Distributed-Database-Stock-Analysis.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook for data retrieval, processing, and performance testing.  
- **`Distributed-Database-Stock-Analysis.sql`** - SQL scripts for partitioning, replication, and event schedulers.  
- **`Distributed-Database-Stock-Analysis.pptx`** - Presentation summarizing project architecture, implementation, and findings.  
- **`project_stock_data.csv`** - Stock market dataset (2020-2023) collected from Yahoo Finance.  

## üìä Dataset Information  
- **Data Source:** Yahoo Finance API  
- **Time Range:** 2020 - 2023  
- **Fields Included:**
  - Stock **open, close, adjusted close, high, low prices**
  - **Trading volume**
  - **Market distribution**
  - **Ticker symbols**  

## üîß System Implementation  
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Partitioning**
- **Horizontal Partitioning**: Splitting stock data based on the **market field**.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Replication**
- **Event Schedulers**: Simulating **asynchronous replication** by syncing stock data from a **source table** to a **target table**.  
- **Comparison**: Evaluating **MySQL event scheduler vs. MySQL asynchronous replication**.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Query Performance Analysis**
- **Using `SHOW PROFILES` to analyze query execution times.**  
- **Comparing performance between raw stock tables vs. partitioned tables.**  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Synchronization & Consistency Testing**
- **Verifying data delay between source and target tables.**  
- **Ensuring correct synchronization of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.**  
- **Testing the scheduled event for synchronizing key stocks (AAPL, GOOGL) across partitions.**  

## üìà Key Findings  
- **Partitioning** improved query efficiency by **reducing query execution time**.  
- **Event schedulers** provided a lightweight alternative to MySQL asynchronous replication.  
- **Synchronization delay was within an acceptable range**, ensuring data consistency.  

## üèÜ Technologies Used  
- **MySQL** (Partitioning, Replication, Event Schedulers)  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Yahoo Finance API)**  
- **SQL Performance Analysis (SHOW PROFILES, Query Optimization)**  

## üöÄ How to Run the Project  
1. **Install Required Packages**  
   ```sh
   pip install pandas yfinance mysql-connector-python
2. Load the SQL Schema (Distributed-Database-Stock-Analysis.sql) into MySQL.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (Distributed-Database-Stock-Analysis.ipynb) for data retrieval and query analysis.
Analyze query performance with MySQL event schedulers.
